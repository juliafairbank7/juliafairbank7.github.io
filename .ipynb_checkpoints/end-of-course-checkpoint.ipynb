    "At the beginning of the year, I decided my participation goals included spending enough time on all of the warm-ups and readings so that I could be involved with my group and in class. Additionally, I set a goal to attend all of the classes that I am physically able to and attend Student Hours or Peer Help as much as I can in order to stay up to date with my coursework and assignments. I am happy to say that, for the most part, I was able to spend time on the warm-ups so that I could be a productive and helpful group member and follow along during class lectures. I also think that my participation was strong, albiet there were more times than I expected to have to miss or be late to class, a result of a busy last semester. I also am happy with my use of Peer Help, I really appreciated Steven's help and benefited greatly from it. "

After our first few meetings, I noticed that each group member had a role that they were either super interested in doing or had the most expertise in and noticed that we were missing someone to write and explain the process as we worked, so I was happy to fill that role. We ended up breaking up the work well, especially once we had a group of four that couldn't always meet all together at the same time. I found that taking time to write our our steps and process was largely beneficial to keep everyone up-to-date on what we had done and what needed to be done.    "
