    "\n",
    "- *How often have you attended class?* I've missed 2 classes due to being sick, communicated ahead of time.\n",
    "- *How often have you taken notes on the core readings ahead of the class period?* ~60% of the time, I read/skim mostly and take notes in class. \n",

So far, I have submitted attempts on 4 blog posts, only one of which is at Revision Useful, two being at Revisions Encouraged, and one that hasn't been graded (and is also a work in progress). However, I've realized that spending more time putting together a comprehensible, complete blog post is more valuable than submitting as many submissions as I can. In that sense, I think I will prioritize bulking up and revising the 4 blog posts I currently have submitted before moving on to the next one. "
